The Shake Chrome extension allows you to create and submit tickets effortlessly from your browser. 
With just a click, you can capture issues, send reports, and share feedback without needing a Shake account or integrating any code into your app.

The extension works seamlessly with Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, Edge, and others.

:::note

Shake Chrome extension has a limited feature set compared to the Shake Web SDK.
If you need advanced functionalities such as user registration, in-app chat, or access to previously reported tickets, you should consider integrating the Shake Web SDK instead.
