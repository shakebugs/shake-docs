> Using Shake in Incognito Mode

<br/>

Yes, Shake works in Incognito too.

Incognito mode is a great way to test websites in a clean environment — no cookies, no cache, just a fresh session. Whether you're reproducing a tricky bug or running through a test flow, Shake will capture everything you need: session replay, console and network logs, device details, and more.

To use Shake in Incognito follow the steps from this gif:

<img
alt="Incognito mode"
src={useBaseUrl('img/chrome-extension/incognito_mode.gif')}
/>

Once that’s on, you’re all set to report bugs from private windows like a pro.
