## Using the Shake UI

Once you take a screenshot (you can add more screenshots or videos), Shake gives you a few handy tools to mark things up:
- Pen,  Circle, Rectangle – highlight exactly what’s going on
- Color picker – change colors to make things pop
- Clear, Select, and Blur – clean up or focus your feedback

Next up, choose where to send it:
Under **Submit to**, you can pick a specific project, or just generate a shareable link.

Then, choose the type of ticket:
**Bug report**, **Question**, or **Suggestion for improvement**.

Finally, there’s a Description box where you can write a quick note with more details.

That’s it – smooth, simple, and straight to your team!

There are also 2 buttons at the button:

1. Report a problem or suggest an improvement (For Shake)
2. Open my Dashboard (Quick access to you dashboard)
