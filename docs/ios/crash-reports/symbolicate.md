> Crash reports are a lot more useful when you see your symbolicated application frames.

## Introduction

In order for crash reports to be symbolicated, you need to upload your dSYM files to Shake.

Unsymbolicated crash reports will appear in the special section of your Shake dashboard.
You will see UUIDs of the required dSYM files which you can then find on your system.

## Enable dSYM files for debug builds

If you plan using crash reporting in a development environment, every debug build action needs to generate dSYM files.
When in your project:

1. Click your _App.xcodeproj_ blue project icon usually located at the top of the _File Inspector_ tab in your left-hand pane
1. Select your main app target
1. Open Build Settings for that target
1. Navigate to the Build Options section
1. Choose _dwarf with dSYM file_ option for your Debug/Development configuration

## Find dSYM files

Run this command in your terminal to list all available dSYM files found on your system so you can identify the ones that are missing:

```finding_dsyms"
// highlight-next-line
mdfind -name .dSYM | while read -r line; do dwarfdump -u "$line"; done
```

## Upload manually to Shake dashboard

Locate your app's dSYM files:
_Xcode → Preferences → Locations → Derived Data_ → click the _Finder_ folder link.

For archived apps with Bitcode enabled, which have already been uploaded to the App Store, visit
_Xcode → Window → Organizer_ to manually download the App Store generated debug symbols
by clicking the _Download Debug Symbols_ button on the right hand pane.

Now zip the symbolication files.

To upload dSYM files to the Shake dashboard:

1. Visit [Workspace administration → Apps](https://app.shakebugs.com)
1. Click your app name to expand it
1. Click the **Mapping files** button
1. Drag and drop your zipped symbolication files there

## Upload dSYM files using RunPhase script

:::note
Use this method if your app doesn't use Bitcode binary format.
:::

Shake ships with the `upload-symbols.sh` script which uploads dSYM files to Shake servers.

To ensure that the latest dSYM files are automatically uploaded after every build process, add a new Run Script Phase:
_Xcode → Scheme → EditScheme_ → expand the _Build Action_ options → _Post Actions → +_

Paste this script but make sure to replace `your-api-client-id` and `your-api-client-secret` with the actual values
you have in [your workspace administration](https://app.shakebugs.com):

```script
//highlight-start
Path/to/upload-symbols.sh \
--client_id your-api-client-id \
--client_secret your-api-client-secret
//highlight-end
```

If your crash reports are not being symbolicated, make sure the script is working properly
by doublechecking the Xcode Build log for Shake upload script errors.
When looking at the Build log, search for the **"SHAKE_SCRIPT"** keyword to identify potential problems and see whether the upload was successful.

## Upload dSYM files using fastlane plugin

:::note
Use this method if your app has Bitcode format enabled.
:::

[fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) is an open source app automation platform ([docs](http://docs.fastlane.tools)).
You can use it to automate App Store Connect authentication and downloading of dSYM files.

### Install fastlane

First, run the `bundle init` command in your terminal which will generate the Gemfile like this one:

<TabItem value="gemifle">

```gemfile title="Gemfile"
// highlight-start
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "fastlane"
// highlight-end
```

</TabItem>

Then, run the `bundle install` command to install fastlane and associated dependencies.

Lastly, navigate your terminal to your project's directory and run the `fastlane init` command.

### Install Shake plugin

<TabItem value="ruby">

```ruby title="Terminal"
// highlight-next-line
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin upload_symbols_to_shake
```

</TabItem>

### Use the plugin

If you have [Bitcode](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devbbdc5ce4f) enabled in your app's project settings,
dSYM files are generated by the App Store when your app is recompiled after the upload. fastlane will need to download them.

In this case, use Shake with [download_dsyms](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/download_dsyms/#download_dsyms) to upload dSYM files:

<TabItem value="ruby">

```ruby title="Fastfile"
// highlight-start
lane :refresh_dsyms do
    download_dsyms(version: "latest")
    upload_symbols_to_shake(client_id: "<Shake client id>", client_secret: "<Shake client secret>", bundle_id: "<Bundle id of project>",  plist_path: "<Path to Info.plist>")
end
// highlight-end
```

</TabItem>

You can find your `<Shake client id>` and `<Shake client secret>` in
[your workspace administration](https://app.shakebugs.com).

On the other hand, if you have [Bitcode](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devbbdc5ce4f) disabled,
add the `upload_symbols_to_shake` action with [gym](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/gym/#gym) to upload dSYMs generated from the build:

<TabItem value="ruby">

```ruby title="Fastfile"
// highlight-start
lane :refresh_dsyms do
    gym
        upload_symbols_to_shake(client_id: "<Shake client id>", client_secret: "<Shake client secret>", bundle_id: "<Bundle id of project>", plist_path: "<Path to Info.plist>")
end
// highlight-end
```

</TabItem>

Or, you can pass the dSYM file paths manually:

<TabItem value="ruby">

```ruby title="Fastfile"
// highlight-next-line
upload_symbols_to_shake(client_id: "<Shake client id>", client_secret: "<Shake client secret>", bundle_id: "<Bundle id of project>", dsym_array_paths: ["./App1.dSYM.zip", "./App2.dSYM.zip"],  plist_path: "<Path to Info.plist>")
```

</TabItem>
