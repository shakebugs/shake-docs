Shake will now [automatically redact sensitive data](/ios/configuration-and-data/manage-sensitive-data/#automatically-redacted-sensitive-data) from your network requests, notifications and touch events so it never reaches Shake servers.

We've added [console logs](/ios/configuration-and-data/activity-history.md#console-logs) to Activity history.

We've all been waiting for this! Your users can record an additional video of their screen or grab one or two more extra screenshots and attach them to the ticket they're submitting ‚Äî without ever leaving your app.

## 14.0
<span class="tag-button">November 5, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Users can finally report different types of feedback: bugs, suggestions and questions.

Shake now allows you to [protect sensitive data](/ios/configuration-and-data/manage-sensitive-data.md) on the mobile device itself, so it never reaches the Shake servers. It can be used for notifications, network requests, screens and screen elements.

You can now use the in-app [intro message](/ios/user-feedback/intro-message.md) to inform your users about Shake availability.
