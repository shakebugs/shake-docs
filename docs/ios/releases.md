This page lists all updates to the Shake iOS SDK.

What would you like us to build next? We're dying to hear from you — just click the button in the bottom-right corner of this screen.

### 9.0
February 14, 2020

**What's new**

Shake is now fully equipped to track user’s full [Activity history](ios/activity.md) — 
browse user's interactions with your app, their network requests and system events prior to a bug being reported.

**Resolved issues**

Shake didn’t show up correctly in projects created in Xcode 11. That’s history now.

### 8.0
December 16, 2019

**What's new**

With a Disable Shake feature you can now easily allow only a portion of your app users to use Shake 
(for example, the ones that have opted in for beta access), while not allowing it to others.

Think globally, act locally. The latest version of Shake SDK has been cautiously translated to 
Spanish, German and French. Users whose default device language is set to one of these, 
will automatically see Shake in their language.

### 7.0
July 16, 2019

**What's new**

Shake now officially, and nicely, works on your tablet apps 

Putting our best foot forward. 
Just like before an airplane crash, Shake now records a user's detailed environment profile covering the last 60 seconds 
before a bug was submitted. This feature is called — you’ve guessed it — [Black box](ios/blackbox.md).

**Resolved issues**

There was a problem where code signing of your app failed if it contained Shake SDK. This will not happen any more.

### 6.0
June 24, 2019

**What's new**

Shake is now a tiny bit cooler because you can also use it in landscape mode.

With [Quick facts](android/quick-facts.md), you can now send a value of literally any variable from a user's app to your web Dashboard.

### 5.0
May 29, 2019

**What's new**

You can now inspect your bug right inside your mobile app, no need to submit it at all. Shake the device and tap the Inspect bug button.

Everyone loves colors! That's why users can now choose from 6 of them.

### 4.1
April 22, 2019

**What's new**

Jolly good! Your users can now leave their email address with every bug report so you can just follow that up.

### 4.0
April 8, 2019

**What's new**

Some things are not meant for sharing. Users can now blur out parts of the screen they want to keep private.

Actually, users are now allowed to delete the screenshot attachment altogether if they feel that way.

Are your users visual types? Instead of shaking their device or taking a screenshot, 
you can put a floating Report a bug button to be constantly visible inside your app. No way to miss that.

**Resolved issues**

You weren't able to invoke Shake SDK inside the Simulator on your computer. Well, now you are.

### 3.0
February 25, 2019

**What's new**

Users can change their brush color to mark the bugs more creatively and clearly.

From now on, your users can report bugs with Shake while on a plane or in a subway. Hooray for full offline support!

**Resolved issues**

Looooong bug descriptions would cause the SDK screen to start jumping up and down on a user's phone. 
Now, everything is running smoothly.

### 2.0
January 28, 2019

**What's new**

If your users want to report bugs by taking a screenshot — instead of shaking their phone — you are all in luck 
because Shake SDK can now be invoked that way too. Head over to [Invoke](ios/invoke.md) to choose your desired SDK invoke gesture.

**Resolved issues**

A user's screenshot would sometimes arrive to you narrower than it actually is. 
We can proudly say it no longer happens.
