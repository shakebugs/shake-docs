The Inspect bug screen allows users to see the details of a bug from their device without reporting it.

## Introduction
Your users can inspect a bug — see its [Essentials](/ios/essentials.md) and [Quick facts](ios/quick-facts.md) — before submitting it. The Inspect bug screen is part of the SDK Wrap-up screen:
