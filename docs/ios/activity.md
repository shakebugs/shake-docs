Shake diligently tracks user's interaction with your app, their network traffic, notifcations, logs and system events, and automatically attaches all of those to every bug report.

## No coding required
You can inspect all events that lead to the bug being reported out-of-the-box. You'll see a link to *Activity history* in the top right corner:

<img
  alt="Activity screen"
  src={useBaseUrl('screens/activity_screen.png')}
/>

## Enabling and disabling
Activity history is enabled by default, however, you can use the method below to disable it:



<Tabs groupId="ios" defaultValue="swift" values={[{ label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objectivec'},{ label: 'Swift', value: 'swift'},]}><TabItem value="objectivec">

```objectivec title="AppDelegate.m"
//highlight-next-line
SHKShake.configuration.isActivityHistoryEnabled = NO;
```

</TabItem><TabItem value="swift">

```swift title="AppDelegate.swift"
//highlight-next-line
Shake.configuration.isActivityHistoryEnabled = false
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

## Custom logs
You can add your own custom logs to Activity history, which will then be shown as part of every bug report.
Hereâ€™s an example of how this would look like in code:

<Tabs
  groupId="ios"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objectivec'},
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift'},
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="objectivec">

```objectivec title="AppDelegate.m"
// highlight-next-line
[SHKShake logWithLevel: LogLevel.info, message:@"Log message goes here!"];
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="swift">

```swift title="AppDelegate.swift"
// highlight-next-line
Shake.log(LogLevel.info, "Log message goes here!")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Limitations
In a Free workspace you can see up to 20 events that lead to every bug.
If you need to dive really deep to find causes of the weirdest bugs,
in a Premium workspace you can browse the entire activity history.
