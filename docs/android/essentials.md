## Customizing the data you receive
If you want the SDK to attach any other variable to your bug reports, you can absolutely do that as well! Read about sending custom data with [Metadata](android/metadata.md).

Do you also want to attach custom files, like images? Visit [Attachments](/android/attachments.md).
