>When users send you tickets, Shake "magically" and automatically captures a lot of other data, too. Although it feels like magic, it's not. We want you to fully understand and control it.

## Collected data

| Data |  Attributes and sensitivity | Description |
|------|:---------------------------:|-------------|
| Phone number &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Not collected. |

| Physical address                             |        | Not collected. |
| Other contact information                    |        | Not collected. |
| Health or fitness data                       |        | Not collected. |
| Payment, credit or other financial info      |        | Not collected. |
| Precise or coarse location                   |        | Not collected. |
| Sensitive info                               |        | Not collected. |
| User's contacts, emails or text messages     |        | Not collected. |
| Photos, videos or other user's files         | <span class="tag-button">Optional</span> <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">May contain PII</span>  | Shake does not automatically collect the contents of the user Gallery or similar locations. However, keep in mind that your users can decide to attach any of their files by browsing their device themselves, and those files could contain PII. |
| Audio or gameplay data                       |        | Not collected. |
| Customer support or other user content       |        | Not collected. |
| Browsing, purchase or search history         |        | Not collected. |
| Device ID                                    |  <span class="tag-button green-tag-button">Non-PII</span>       | Bundle identifier, DeviceID, platform and operating system. Not used for advertising. |
| Product interaction                                   | <span class="tag-button">Optional</span> <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">May contain PII</span>   | Shake's [Activity history](/android/configuration-and-data/activity-history.md) shows a timeline of all user actions (every tap, swipe, pan), their network requests (request header and body, response header and body), system events (app status changes), view controller changes (the user navigating your app), push notifications that arrive, custom logs and application console logs. Shake SDK [automatically deletes as much PII as possible](/android/configuration-and-data/manage-sensitive-data.md#automatically-redacted-sensitive-data) on the mobile device itself. It also [gives you additional methods](/android/configuration-and-data/manage-sensitive-data.md) to manage, delete and obfuscate any potential PII on the mobile device itself before anything is sent to Shake servers.         |
| Advertising data                             |        | Not collected. |
| Other usage data                             |        | Not collected. |
| Crash data                                   | <span class="tag-button">Optional</span>  <span class="tag-button green-tag-button">Non-PII</span>       | Shake's [Crash reporting](android/crash-reports/overview.md) module. You can disable it.   |
| Performance data                                           | <span class="tag-button">Optional</span> <span class="tag-button green-tag-button">Non-PII</span>          | Shake's [Black box](/ios/configuration-and-data/black-box.md) can show you the last 60 seconds of device memory usage, your app memory usage, network connectivity changes, device orientation and the CPU levels. You can also disable it.       |
| Other diagnostic data                        |  <span class="tag-button green-tag-button">Non-PII</span>       | Collected.     |
| [Screenshot](/android/configuration-and-data/auto-screenshot.md)         | <span class="tag-button">Optional</span> <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">May contain PII</span>    | A screenshot of the user's screen at the moment Shake is invoked. You can avoid capturing PII on the screenshot by [marking sensitive views as private](/ios/configuration-and-data/manage-sensitive-data.md#views). In the case of manual invocation, your users can additionally blur or delete the screenshot before submitting the ticket.      | 
| [Screen recording](/android/configuration-and-data/auto-screen-recording.md) | <span class="tag-button">Optional</span> <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">May contain PII</span>   | Automatically-captured video of what the user did in your app during the last 15 seconds prior to submitting a ticket. It's disabled by default. If you enable it, your users will be asked to allow screen recording first and will have the ability to delete it before submitting the ticket too. Shake doesn't record other apps' content — just yours. Use this optional feature only during internal testing.     |
| [Permissions](/android/configuration-and-data/data-attached-by-default.md)                     | <span class="tag-button green-tag-button">Non-PII</span>                                                                     | A list of permissions the user has granted to your app.                                                                          |
| [User email](/android/configuration-and-data/new-ticket-screen-elements.md)                            | <span class="tag-button">Optional</span> <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">May contain PII</span>   | The user that's submitting a ticket enters this data themselves. If you decide you don't want to collect this data, you can hide this field.     |

As with any network header on the Internet — that's how the Internet works — Shake SDK's header also contains the sender's IP address. Shake servers read only the request's city (nothing more geographically precise than that), saves that city name and never saves the IP address. Even though some don't consider the IP address PII, we choose to err on the side of caution and want to ensure everyone’s complete safety and security by not saving it.    |

## Additional notes

You may receive PII if you don't use Shake carefully so please:
* Double-check additional files and data you attach to tickets.
* Openly disclose collected data with the regulating authority, such as the app store.
* [Protect sensitive data](/android/configuration-and-data/manage-sensitive-data) to avoid capturing and sending PII to Shake servers.
