## Version

### 14.0
<span class="tag-button">November 5, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="tag-button green-tag-button">Latest version</span>

**What's new**

We are introducing you completely fresh design, new navigation and a better user experience.  
Users can now report [different type of feedbacks](/android/feedback_type.md) - bugs, suggestions and questions.

[Private data](/android/privacy.md) management is finally here, Shake provides you a way to mask or remove data
you do not want to be visible on the Shake dashboard.
It can be used for notifications, network requests, screens or screen elements.

From now, you can use in app Shake [onboarding dialog](/android/usage_prompt.md) to inform your users about Shake availability.

### 13.1
<span class="tag-button">August 25, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

**What's new**

If you want to, you can now pre-fill or hide the [Email field](/android/email.md) from the SDK. Pretty neat.

### 13.0
<span class="tag-button">June 30, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

**What's new**

Screenshots are cool, but wouldn't it be even cooler if you could watch a 30 second video of what a user did before reporting the bug? That's why we introduced [Screen recording](/android/screen-recording.md).

### 12.0
<span class="tag-button">May 19, 2020</span>

**What's new**

Not all of you love the default Shake color. Now, whenever users open it up,
Shake can appear in your brand color and with your logo.

You wanted us to get rid of Quick Facts (one long concatenated string)
and introduce [Metadata](/android/metadata.md) (useful key-value pairs) instead. So we did it.

### 11.0
<span class="tag-button">April 1, 2020</span>

**What's new**

Your users can at last attach their own files to a bug report!
They can also remove any of them with a subtle long press. Neat.

There’s no such thing as too many [invocation methods](/android/invoke.md).
Shake can now be invoked by a one-finger swiping gesture from the right edge of the screen too.

The Wrap-up screen is now a tiny bit more helpful than before.
If your users want to, they can read how to report great bugs, report any SDK hiccups to us or recommend us.

If you want to, our [Activity history](/android/activity.md) now allows you to send yourself any custom logs,
and read the notifications users receive.

### 10.0
<span class="tag-button">March 12, 2020</span>

**What's new**

To continue delivering you more and more options in a scalable manner,
we have rewritten the whole Android SDK API Version 10.
 It's like getting a flu shot — feel free to hate us for a few minutes while you tweak a call or two,
 but we sincerely promise you'll enjoy all the benefits 100 times over.

By popular demand, Shake can now be [invoked through code](/android/invoke.md) as well.

Submit yourself a [silent bug report](/android/silent-reports.md) from the background,
without interrupting your end user whatsoever!

Privacy options are important. That’s why you now have a method to
disable or enable [Activity history](/android/activity.md) whenever you want to.

If you want to, you can [hide the Inspect bug button](/android/inspect.md) from your users. Brilliant.

### 9.0
<span class="tag-button">February 14, 2020</span>

**What's new**

Shake is now fully equipped to track user’s full [Activity history](/android/activity.md) —
browse user's interactions with your app, their network requests and system events prior to a bug being reported.

### 8.0
<span class="tag-button">December 16, 2019</span>

**What's new**

With a Disable Shake feature you can now easily allow only a portion of your app users to use Shake
(for example, the ones that have opted in for beta access), while not allowing it to others.

Think globally, act locally. The latest version of Shake SDK has been cautiously translated to
Spanish, German and French. Users whose default device language is set to one of these,
will automatically see Shake in their language.

### 7.0
<span class="tag-button">July 16, 2019</span>

**What's new**

Shake now officially, and nicely, works on your tablet apps

Putting our best foot forward. Just like before an airplane crash, Shake now records a user's detailed
environment profile covering the last 60 seconds before a bug was submitted. This feature is called —
you’ve guessed it — [Black box](/android/blackbox.md).

### 6.0
<span class="tag-button">June 24, 2019</span>

**What's new**

Shake is now a tiny bit cooler because you can also use it in landscape mode.

With [Quick facts](/android/quick-facts.md), you can now send a value of literally any variable
from a user's app to your web Dashboard.

### 5.0
<span class="tag-button">May 29, 2019</span>

**What's new**

You can now inspect your bug right inside your mobile app, no need to submit it at all.
Shake the device and tap the Inspect bug button.

Everyone loves colors! That's why users can now choose from 6 of them.

### 4.1
<span class="tag-button">April 22, 2019</span>

**What's new**

Jolly good! Your users can now leave their email address with every bug report so you can just follow that up.

### 4.0
<span class="tag-button">April 8, 2019</span>

**What's new**

Some things are not meant for sharing. Users can now blur out parts of the screen they want to keep private.

Actually, users are now allowed to delete the screenshot attachment altogether if they feel that way.

Are your users visual types? Instead of shaking their device or taking a screenshot,
you can put a floating Report a bug button to be constantly visible inside your app. No way to miss that.

### 3.0
<span class="tag-button">February 25, 2019</span>

**What's new**

Users can change their brush color to mark the bugs more creatively and clearly.

From now on, your users can report bugs with Shake while on a plane or in a subway. Hooray for full offline support!

**Resolved issues**

Looooong bug descriptions would cause the SDK screen to start jumping up and down on a user's phone. Now, everything is running smoothly.

### 2.0
<span class="tag-button">January 28, 2019</span>

**What's new**

If your users want to report bugs by taking a screenshot — instead of shaking their phone — you are all in luck
because Shake SDK can now be invoked that way too. Head over to [Invoke](/android/invoke.md) to choose your desired SDK invoke gesture.
