The *Inspect ticket* screen allows users to see the details of report attached to the current ticket.

## Introduction

Your users can inspect the current ticket — see its [Essentials](android/essentials.md) and [Metadata](android/metadata.md) — before submitting it.

The *Inspect screen* can be reached via *Inspect* button on the [New ticket screen](android/new-ticket-screen.md).
