This page covers how Shake reports to you on the status of a user's permissions listed below.

## Introduction
Shake precisely lists permissions that a user has explicitly granted access to.
The ones you don't see listed in a report were either denied or not requested at all.

You can review user granted permissions on the Dashboard.
