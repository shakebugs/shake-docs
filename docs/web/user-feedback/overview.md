## Introduction

You have various options for how, when and where to invoke Shake in your app.
Explore the docs and customize Shake's User feedback module to your needs.

To get you started, here are just two examples:

1. Open Shake screen using the default Shake floating button. You don't have to code anything.
2. Open Shake screen from the code by pressing custom "Send feedback" button in the about screen.

## Configuration & data

User feedback module pulls your [Configuration and data](/web/configuration-and-data/overview.md) settings.

This means that all user feedback comes to you with an [auto screenshot](/web/configuration-and-data/screen-capture.md),
of what happened before the ticket was submitted and other useful data.
