As with any network header on the Internet — that's how the Internet works — Shake SDK's header also contains the sender's IP address. Shake servers read only the request's city (nothing more geographically precise than that), saves that city name and never saves the IP address. Even though some don't consider the IP address PII, we choose to err on the side of caution and want to ensure everyone’s complete safety and security by not saving it. |
