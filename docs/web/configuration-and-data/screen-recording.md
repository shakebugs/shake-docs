## Manual recording

Shake allows its users to attach additional screen recording using in-built screen recorder.
Screen recordings are a useful way to enrich and describe your feedback and bug reports.

Screen recording is not attached automatically, instead it is attached by user by pressing
**Record screen** button in the **Attachments** section.

## Privacy

When user starts screen recording, user must select screen section he wants to record.

User can choose to record just one tab, whole window or whole screen. In the case whole screen is selected, 
screen recording will also capture other apps and desktop instead just host app.
