> Sometimes you'll want to tag your tickets for easier management and organization on the dashboard.
There are three different options you can use to add tags to the tickets.

## Adding tags using the ticket title

Use ticket title to add tags to the ticket.

Shake automatically identifies and converts any *#some #hashtags* found in the title of your tickets into the tags.

They will automatically become <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">tags</span> on your [Shake dashboard](https://app.shakebugs.com/).

## Adding tags using the feedback type picker

Use form picker to add tags to the ticket.

Depending on the picker item selected by the user, Shake will automatically add defined <span class="tag-button blue-tag-button">tag</span> to the ticket.
