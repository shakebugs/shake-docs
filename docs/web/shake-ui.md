> Shake's user interface explained and instructions on how to customize it.

## Screens

The Shake UI consists of several different screens:

### New ticket

Used to provide additional details about the user feedback. For example - description and file.

<table class="media-container mt-40 mb-40">
<img
  alt="Shake screens structure"
  width="800"
  src={useBaseUrl('screens/shake-web-sdk-new-ticket.png')}
/>
</table>

### Home screen

Central place for registered app user where all user tickets are listed.

<table class="media-container mt-40 mb-40">
<img
  alt="Shake screens structure"
  width="800"
  src={useBaseUrl('screens/shake-web-sdk-home.png')}
/>
</table>

### Chat screen
Used to chat and provide more details to the Shake dashboard users.

<table class="media-container mt-40 mb-40">
<img
  alt="Shake screens structure"
  width="800"
  src={useBaseUrl('screens/shake-web-sdk-chat.png')}
/>
</table>

## Opening Shake

You can decide to open Shake screen either using default floating button or from the code, depending on the flow you want to achieve.
Listed below are some common use cases that show where you might like to add Shake to your app.
Of course, it's up to you to decide what best suits your app UX.

### Internal feedback collection

This entry point is often used during internal testing. Your testers or office colleagues are told to invoke Shake whenever they notice a bug or have a suggestion.
In this case, you'll probably want to use default floating button to open Shake. You don't need to code anything, the button is available after Shake is initialized.

### Production ticketing system

In production, apps usually add Shake under **My account or Settings â†’ Help**.
There, they have a **Submit feedback** button that opens Shake's screen.
In this case, you'll want to show Shake when a button is clicked.

## Mobile design

Shake UI is build completely with responsive design on mind. It means that it will automatically adjust its user interface
to the screen resolution it is used on, both for mobile and tablet devices.
