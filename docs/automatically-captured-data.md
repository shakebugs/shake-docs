title: Automatically captured data
---
When users send you feedback, Shake "magically" and automatically captures a lot of other data too. And although it feels like magic, it's nothing but — we want you to fully understand and control it.

Shake also provides you with tools to filter out any personally identifiable information (PII) on the mobile device itself, so it never reaches the Shake servers.

We're truly obsessed with data security! If you have questions or proposals, [let's start chatting](mailto:friends@shakebugs.com).


## Not automatically captured

Before we list data Shake SDK does capture, we first want to give you many examples of data Shake doesn't automatically collect. We want you to know all the details you may later need for compliance, when submitting your app to any app store, or for any other reason.

You can avoid capturing PII on the screenshot by [marking sensitive views as private](https://www.shakebugs.com/docs/ios/manage-sensitive-data#views). In case of manual invocation, your users can additionally blur or delete the screenshot before submitting feedback.      |

It's disabled by default. If you enable it, your users will be asked to allow screen recording first, and will have the ability to delete it before submitting feedback too. Shake doesn't record other apps' content, just yours. Use this optional feature only during internal testing.     |

Our system reads only the user's city (nothing more geographically precise than that) from it, saves that city name and never ever saves the IP address. Even though some don't consider the IP address PII, we choose to disagree and want to keep everyone completely safe and secure by not saving it.    |

Shake SDK [automatically deletes as much PII as possible](https://www.shakebugs.com/docs/android/manage-sensitive-data#automatically-redacted-sensitive-data) on the mobile device itself, and [gives you additional methods](https://www.shakebugs.com/docs/android/manage-sensitive-data) to manage, delete and obfuscate any of potentially PII also on the mobile device itself, before anything is sent to Shake servers.         |
