title: Automatically captured data

When users send you feedback, Shake "magically" and automatically captures a lot of other data too. And although it feels like magic, it's nothing but — we want you to fully understand and control it.

Shake also provides you with tools to filter out any personally identifiable information (PII) on the mobile device itself, so it never reaches the Shake servers.

We're truly obsessed with data security! If you have questions or proposals, [let's start chatting](mailto:friends@shakebugs.com).


## Not automatically captured

Before we list data Shake SDK does capture, we first want to give you many examples of data Shake doesn't automatically collect. We want you to know all the details you may later need for compliance, when submitting your app to any app store, or for any other reason.
