>The Users module enables you to see a list of your app users, their attributes and tickets on your Shake dashboard. In parallel, it allows them to see their previously submitted tickets.

<table class="media-container">
<img
  alt="User module"
  width="340"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/module-users@2x.png')}
/>
</table>

Current features include:
* Your app users can see their previously sent tickets on the [Home screen](/flutter/shake-ui/home-screen.md).
* You have all your app users listed in one place on your Shake dashboard.
* Your [users' custom attributes](/flutter/users/update-user-metadata) are tracked automatically.
* You and your app users can [live chat](/flutter/users/chat) with each other.

Soon, these features will be available too:
* On your Shake dashboard, you will see an app User which has submitted a Ticket. And all Tickets sent by a particular app User.
* You will be able to see your MAU and DAU charts.

Start by [registering your app users](/flutter/users/register-user.md).
