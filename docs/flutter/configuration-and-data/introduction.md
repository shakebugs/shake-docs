Maybe you want to attach custom data to Shake reports so you can fix bugs easier, 
show the email field on the [New Ticket screen](flutter/screens/new-ticket-screen.md) so users can leave an email,
or you want to show the [intro message](flutter/configuration-and-data/intro-message.md) to your users and inform them how to send feedback.

Shake provides you an option to customize report data and configure Shake behavior.
Data customizations and Shake configurations are applied to all available products.
