## Introduction

Here, your user can see:

- A welcome message that you can change from [Shake SDK](/flutter/configuration-and-data/home-screen#changing-the-home-screen-subtitle).
- A button to submit a new ticket. This section can be [customized](/flutter/configuration-and-data/home-screen#setting-up-custom-actions).
- All their previous tickets.
  To show them their previous tickets, [register your users](/flutter/users/overview) with Shake.
