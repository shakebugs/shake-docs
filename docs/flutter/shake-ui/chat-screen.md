If you [register app users](/flutter/users/register-user) with Shake, they will have all their previous tickets listed on the [Home screen](/flutter/shake-ui/home-screen).
Tapping any ticket there opens its Chat screen.

Your app users can reply to your messages and provide you with more details 
about the bugs and feedback they've sent, all without ever leaving your app.
Fix issues more easily and keep your app users happy.

Visit [Chat](/flutter/users/chat/) to learn more.
