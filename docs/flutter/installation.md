>Learn how to add Shake to your Flutter app.

:::note
Shake supports post Flutter 1.12 projects. If your project was created with the older version
of Flutter, please migrate your project to the new Android APIs via [official guide](https://flutter.dev/go/android-project-migration) first.
:::


## Install

Add Shake as a dependency:

```bash
//highlight-next-line
flutter pub add shake_flutter
```

This will add a line like this to your package's *pubspec.yaml* (and run an implicit `flutter pub get`):

import FlutterVersionBlock from '@site/src/base/FlutterVersionBlock';

<FlutterVersionBlock></FlutterVersionBlock>

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart title="main.dart"
//highlight-next-line
import 'package:shake_flutter/shake_flutter.dart';
```

## Set compileSdkVersion version in the build.gradle file
Since Shake requires `compileSdkVersion` 29 or greater, verify that `compileSdkVersion` is correctly set in the */android/app/build.gradle* file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
android {
    // highlight-next-line
    compileSdkVersion 29

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.shakebugs.flutter.example"
        minSdkVersion 24
        targetSdkVersion 29
        versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
        versionName flutterVersionName
    }
}
```

## Initialize Shake

Call `Shake.start()` method in your *main.dart* file. 
Replace `your-api-client-id` and `your-api-client-secret` with the actual values you have in [your workspace settings](https://app.shakebugs.com/settings/workspace#general):

```dart title="main.dart"
//highlight-next-line
import 'package:shake_flutter/shake_flutter.dart';

void main() {
    //highlight-start
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    
    Shake.setShowFloatingReportButton(true);
    Shake.setInvokeShakeOnShakeDeviceEvent(true);
    Shake.setInvokeShakeOnScreenshot(true);
    Shake.start('your-api-client-id', 'your-api-client-secret');
    //highlight-end

    runApp(Home());
}
```

Build and run your project by selecting *Run â†’ Run* in the menu bar. This first run will automatically
add your app to your [Shake dashboard](https://app.shakebugs.com/) based on your app bundle ID.

## Conditional initialization

We recommend initializing Shake in the entry point of your app.
However, depending on your app, you'll want to initialize Shake just in a specific conditions, depending on your app data.
You can do it as shown in the example below when your app data is available:

```dart title="main_screen.dart"
//highlight-next-line
import 'package:shake_flutter/shake_flutter.dart';

class _MainScreenState extends State<MainScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    if (User.isTester) {
        // highlight-next-line
        Shake.start('your-api-client-id', 'your-api-client-secret');
    }
  }
```

## Visit your Shake dashboard

Follow the instructions there to send your first feedback with Shake and you're all set.

## SDK customizations

Now that Shake SDK is in your app and you have sent the first feedback for fun, everything else is optional.
As the next step, try the three most popular SDK customizations:
