> Learn how to add Shake to your Flutter app.

:::note
Shake supports post Flutter 1.12 projects. If your project was created with the older version
of Flutter, please migrate your project to the new Android APIs via [official guide](https://flutter.dev/go/android-project-migration) first.
:::

## Create a new app on Dashboard

Visit your [Shake Dashboard](https://app.shakebugs.com) and add a new Android/iOS Flutter app by clicking the _+_ button in the sidebar.
Once you're done, you're ready to proceed with the steps below.

## Add Shake dependency to your pubspec.yaml file

Add Shake as a dependency:

```bash
//highlight-next-line
flutter pub add shake_flutter
```

This will add a line like this to your package's _pubspec.yaml_ (and run an implicit `flutter pub get`):

import FlutterVersionBlock from '@site/src/base/FlutterVersionBlock';

<FlutterVersionBlock></FlutterVersionBlock>

## Initialize Shake

Call `Shake.start()` method in your _main.dart_ file.
Replace `your-api-client-id` and `your-api-client-secret` with the actual values you have in [your workspace administration](https://app.shakebugs.com/administration):

```dart title="main.dart"
//highlight-next-line
import 'package:shake_flutter/shake_flutter.dart';

void main() {
    //highlight-start
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    Shake.start('your-api-client-id', 'your-api-client-secret');
    //highlight-end

    runApp(Home());
}
```

Build and run your project by selecting _Run â†’ Run_ in the menu bar.

## Conditional initialization

We recommend initializing Shake in the entry point of your app.
However, depending on your app, you'll want to initialize Shake just in a specific conditions, depending on your app data.
You can do it as shown in the example below when your app data is available:

```dart title="main_screen.dart"
//highlight-next-line
import 'package:shake_flutter/shake_flutter.dart';

class _MainScreenState extends State<MainScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    if (User.isTester) {
        // highlight-next-line
        Shake.start('your-api-client-id', 'your-api-client-secret');
    }
  }
```

## Visit your Shake dashboard

Follow the instructions there to send your first feedback with Shake and you're all set.

## SDK customizations

Now that Shake SDK is in your app and you have sent the first feedback for fun, everything else is optional.
As the next step, try the three most popular SDK customizations:
