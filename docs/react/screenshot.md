This page covers the most obvious content pieces found in every bug report sent to the
 web Dashboard — bug description and the screenshot.

## Introduction
User's screenshot and their brief description of what's happened are 2 most common pieces of
data developers receive with Shake SDK, and you will find this data at the top of your Dashboard.

<img
  alt="Bug screen"
  src={useBaseUrl('screens/bug_screen.png')}
/>


## User drawing on the screenshot
When users shake their phone and the SDK pops up, they are encouraged to additionally mark a 
spot on the screenshot that seems odd to them.
