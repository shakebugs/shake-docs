There's a simple way to inform all your app users (or testers) how to send feedback.

## How to use
If enabled, a one-off intro message will be shown to a user as soon as they open up your app for the first time. This message is disabled by default, but you can easily enable it using the following method:

```javascript title="App.js"
// highlight-next-line
Shake.setShowIntroMessage(false);
```
