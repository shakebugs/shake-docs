Users is a simple product for having all your app users listed in one place, automatically.

Register them and track their custom attributes. Soon you'll also be able to:

* see which tester hasn't signed in for a week
* see a production user with most crashes
* see your MAU and DAU charts
* live chat with all of them

Check our [installation guide](react/install/installation.md) to start using Shake in your app.
