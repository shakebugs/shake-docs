This SDK option allows your users to categorize their feedback.

## Introduction
When submitting their feedback, your users immediately categorize it as either a bug report, an improvement suggestion, or just a question.

Depending on their choice, you automatically receive the <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">bug</span>, <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">suggestion</span> or <span class="tag-button pink-tag-button">question</span> tag next to their ticket in your [Shake Dashboard](https://app.shakebugs.com). This way, you can filter and browse them efficiently!

## Disabling
If you donâ€™t want your users to have to categorize their feedback, simply hide this option using the following method:

```javascript title="App.js"
// highlight-next-line
Shake.setEnableMultipleFeedbackTypes(false);
```

On your Shake Dashboard, all these tickets won't have any specific type (and tag).
