### 10.0
July 3, 2020

**What's new**

To continue delivering you more and more options in a scalable manner,
we have rewritten the whole Android SDK API Version 10.
 It's like getting a flu shot — feel free to hate us for a few minutes while you tweak a call or two,
 but we sincerely promise you'll enjoy all the benefits 100 times over.

By popular demand, Shake can now be [invoked through code](/react/invoke.md) as well.

Submit yourself a [silent bug report](/react/silent-reports.md) from the background,
without interrupting your end user whatsoever!

Privacy options are important. That’s why you now have a method to
disable or enable [Activity history](/react/activity.md) whenever you want to.

If you want to, you can [hide the Inspect bug button](/react/inspect.md) from your users. Brilliant.


### 9.0
June 17, 2020

**What's new**

You can now use Shake React Native SDK in the React Native applications. Check [Setup](/react/setup.md) guide and follow step by step
guide to integrate Shake SDK into your React Native application.
