## Version

### 10.0
<span class="tag-button">September 8, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="tag-button green-tag-button">Latest version</span>

**What's new**

By popular demand, Shake can now be [invoked through code](/react/invoke.md) as well.

Submit yourself a [silent bug report](/react/silent-reports.md) from the background,
without interrupting your end user whatsoever!

Privacy options are important. That’s why you now have a method to
disable or enable [Activity history](/react/activity.md) whenever you want to.

If you want to, you can [hide the Inspect bug button](/react/inspect.md) from your users. Brilliant.
