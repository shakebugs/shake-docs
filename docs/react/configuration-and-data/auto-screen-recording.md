>You can rely on your testers to record a video of their screen and attach it to their feedback and crash reports.
Or, you can use auto screen recording to always record their screen and automatically attach that video to the ticket.

## Enable
Auto screen recording is disabled by default. To enable it:
1. Add permission to the **AndroidManifest.xml** to support Android 14+
1. Call `Shake.setAutoVideoRecording(true)`.
1. Then, start Shake with `Shake.start()`.

```xml title="AndroidManifest.xml"
// highlight-next-line
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION" />
```

```javascript title="App.js"
// highlight-next-line
Shake.setAutoVideoRecording(true);
```

  width="380"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/phone-auto-screenrecording@2x.png')}
/>
</table>

Duration of the auto-attached screen recording is 15 seconds.

## Privacy

With this feature turned on, a system dialog will ask your testers if they want to allow your app
to start capturing everything that's displayed on their screen.

Screen recording is automatically paused when your app goes to background so no third-party data is ever recorded.

Visit [Protect sensitive data](/react/configuration-and-data/manage-sensitive-data/#auto-screen-recording) to learn
how to hide sensitive data from the auto screen recording.
